# Daily Use GPG Configuration Environment


These GnuPG configuration files are intended to provide a reasonable 
balance between strong security and compatibility with other users'
PGP clients and environments.

Many of the settings are optional, and the user is encourged to review
the settings and become familiar with their function, and customize
these configuration parameters as seen fit.
